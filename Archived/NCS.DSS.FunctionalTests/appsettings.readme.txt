To configure this project to run locally, an app settings file must be installed in the expected location:

For Windows:

%HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%\ncsapi\appsettings.local.json

eg:
C:\Users\bob\ncsapi\appsettings.local.json

There is a place holder version of this file in the solution folder which may be copied to the required location and populated with appropriate values.
